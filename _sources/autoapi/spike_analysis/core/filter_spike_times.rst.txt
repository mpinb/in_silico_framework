filter_spike_times
==================


.. py:function:: spike_analysis.core.filter_spike_times(spike_times, spike_times_trough, creast_trough_interval=2, mode=&#39;latest&#39;, spike_times_amplitude=None, upper_creast_threshold=None, creast_upcross_times=None)

   Filter spike times based on timepoints of detected creasts and troughs.

   A spike is detected by its trough.
   Then, this method checks if there is a corresponding creast at maximum :paramref:`creast\_trough\_interval` before the trough.
   All creasts fullfilling this criterion are extracted.
   The spike time is set to the latest creast (if :paramref:`mode` = ``latest``) or the maximum creast amplitude (if :paramref:`mode` = ``creast\_max``).

   If a through does not have a corresponding creast, no spike is detected.

   :Parameters: * **spike\_times** (*list*) -- list containing spike times defined by the creast of the waveform
                * **spike\_times\_trough** (*list*) -- list containing spike times defined by the trough of the waveform

   :returns: list, containing spikes fullfilling the definition above.
   :rtype: filtered\_spike\_times
