read_smr_file
=============


.. py:function:: spike_analysis.core.read_smr_file(path)

   Reads a Spike2 file and returns its content as a neo.core.block.Block object.

   To avoid modifying the original Spike2 file, a copy of the file is first created in a temporary folder.
   The copy is then read and returned as a neo.core.block.Block object. Finally, the temporary folder is deleted.

   :Parameters: **path** (*str*) -- Absolute path to the Spike2 file.

   :returns: A :py:class:`~neo.core.block.Block` object containing the content of the Spike2 file.
   :rtype: :py:class:`neo.core.block.Block`
