===============


.. py:function:: spike_analysis.core.get_peaks_above(t, v, lim)

   Compute timepoints of maxima above a threshold.

   :Parameters: * **t** (*list*) -- A list containing timepoints.
                * **v** (*list*) -- A list containing recorded voltage.
                * **lim** (*float*) -- A threshold above which (>=) maxima are detected.

   :returns: A list containing timepoints of maxima.
             max\_v (list): A list containing voltage at timepoints of maxima.
   :rtype: max\_t (list)
