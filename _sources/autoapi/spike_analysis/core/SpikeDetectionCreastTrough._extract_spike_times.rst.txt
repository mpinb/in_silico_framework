SpikeDetectionCreastTrough._extract_spike_times
===============================================

.. py:method:: spike_analysis.core.SpikeDetectionCreastTrough._extract_spike_times()

   Extracts spike times from voltage traces.

   Extracts spike times based on creast and trough amplitude.
   Only returns spike times that fullfill both the creast and trough criterion and have an ISI above :paramref:`tdelta`.
   Spikes that only fullfill the creast criterion are stored in :paramref:`_spike_times_creast`, and similarly for the trough criterion.

   :returns: A list containing spike times.
   :rtype: list
