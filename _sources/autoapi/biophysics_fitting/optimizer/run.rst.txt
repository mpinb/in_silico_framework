.. py:function:: biophysics_fitting.optimizer.run(self, max_ngen=10, offspring_size=None, continue_cp=False, cp_filename=None, cp_frequency=1, pop=None, db=None)

   This method is a class method of the BluePyOpt optimisations.DEAPOptimisation class.
   It is extended here such that a start population can be defined.
   Running actual optimization is done with the :meth:`~biophysics\_fitting.optimizer.start\_run`, which further extends this method.

   .. note::

      the population needs to be in a special format. Use methods in biophysics\_fitting.population
      to create a population.
