bAP.check
=========

.. py:method:: biophysics_fitting.hay.evaluation.bAP.check(out, voltage_traces)

   Check for problems in the voltage trace.

   This should be called after evaluating the voltage traces.
   it is e.g. the last step in :py:meth:`get`, where it adds the checks to the output dictionary.

   This method checks if the voltage trace:

   - has at least 1 AP present.
   - properly returns to rest.
   - has no spikes before stimulus onset (in soma or dendrite).
   - has its last spike before the deadline.

   :Parameters: * **out** -- dictionary with the evaluation metrics
                * **voltage_traces** -- dictionary with the voltage traces of the soma and dendrite.

   :returns: dictionary with the evaluation metrics, containing the raw values, normalized values, and checks.
   :rtype: dict
