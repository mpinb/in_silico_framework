.. title:

get_feasible_model_params
=========================


.. py:function:: biophysics_fitting.hay.specification.get_feasible_model_params()

   Get a set of feasible model parameters.

   This dataframe contains biophysical parameters that are not only within range,
   but also likely values to find.
   They are however not guaranteed to yield realistic responses to a stimulus, when
   applied to a L5PT.
   In general, the response of a cell with these biophysical parameters
   heavily depends on the morphology as well.

   Conductance parameters (:math:`\bar{g}` or :math:`g\_{pas}`) are in units of :math:`S/cm^2`, :math:`\tau` parameters are in units of :math:`ms`
   and :math:`\gamma` parameters are a fraction and unitless.

   :returns: A DataFrame with the parameter names as index, feasible values as column 'x', and the min and max.
   :rtype: pd.DataFrame

   .. note::

      The parameters are specific to the L5PT and the Hay stimulus protocol.
      See :cite:t:`Hay\_Hill\_Schuermann\_Markram\_Segev\_2011`.
