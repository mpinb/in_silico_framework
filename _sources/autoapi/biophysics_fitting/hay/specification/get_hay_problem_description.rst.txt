get_hay_problem_description
===========================


.. py:function:: biophysics_fitting.hay.specification.get_hay_problem_description()

   Get the problem description used in :cite:t:`Hay\_Hill\_Schuermann\_Markram\_Segev\_2011`.

   This method returns a dataframe that contains the objective names,
   the average value per objective, and the std per objective.
   Each objective is associated with a specific input stimulus, given in the 'stim\_name' column.
   This distribution of parametrized responses can be used to quantify a cell's response to a specific stimulus.

   The resulting pd.DataFrame contains the following columns:

   - objective: The name of the objective as an acronym, prefixed with the stimulus.
   - feature: The full name of the objective.
   - stim\_name: The name of the stimulus.
   - stim\_type: The type of the stimulus (bAP, BAC or SquarePulse).
   - mean: The empirically observed mean value of the feature.
   - std: The empirically observed standard deviation of the feature.

   The names of the objectives are prefixed with the stimulus name. The suffix
   acronyms mean the following:
