vmApical_position
=================


.. py:function:: biophysics_fitting.utils.vmApical_position(cell, dist=None)

   Fetch the exact location on the apical dendrite at a certain distance from the soma.

   Assumes that the :py:class:`~single\_cell\_parser.cell.Cell` object has an apical dendrite:

   - It contains at least one section with the label "ApicalDendrite"
   - Such section exists at :paramref:`~dist` distance from the soma
   - The section has at least one child

   See :py:meth:`~get\_inner\_section\_at\_distance` for more information about which arguments can be used
   to define an apical section.

   :Parameters: * **cell** (:py:class:`~single\_cell\_parser.cell.Cell`) -- The cell object.
                * **dist** (*float*) -- The distance from the soma (:math:`\mu m`).

   :returns: The point on the apical dendrite at the specified distance.
   :rtype: numpy.ndarray
