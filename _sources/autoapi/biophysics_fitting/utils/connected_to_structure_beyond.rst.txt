connected_to_structure_beyond
=============================


.. py:function:: biophysics_fitting.utils.connected_to_structure_beyond(cell, sec, beyond_dist, beyond_struct=[&#39;ApicalDendrite&#39;], n_children_required=1)

   Checks if a :py:class:`~single\_cell\_parser.cell.Cell` section is connected to a structure
   at a soma distance larger than :paramref:`beyond\_dist`.

   :Parameters: * **cell** (:py:class:`~single\_cell\_parser.cell.Cell`) -- The cell object.
                * **sec** (:py:class:`~single\_cell\_parser.section.Section`) -- The section to check.
                * **beyond\_dist** (*float*) -- The distance from the soma to check.
                * **beyond\_struct** (*list*) -- The labels of the structures to check.
                * **n\_children\_required** (*int*) -- The minimum number of children required to have a connection.

   This can be helpful to detect the main bifurcation of a L5PT, which is the bifurcation in which both children are connected to the tuft.
