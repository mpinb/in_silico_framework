.. title:

get_inner_sec_dist_dict
=======================


.. py:function:: biophysics_fitting.utils.get_inner_sec_dist_dict(cell, beyond_dist=1000, beyond_struct=[&#39;ApicalDendrite&#39;], n_children_required=1)

   Get sections that connect to specific structures beyond a minimum distance.

   Fetches all sections that are connected to compartments with labels in :paramref:`beyond\_struct`, and
   that have a minimum soma distance of :paramref:`beyond\_dist`.
   This is useful to get sections of the apical trunk of an L5PT, filtering out oblique dendrites.

   :Parameters: * **cell** (:py:class:`~single\_cell\_parser.cell.Cell`) -- The cell object.
                * **beyond\_dist** (*float*) -- The minimum distance from the soma (um).
                * **beyond\_struct** (*list*) -- The labels of the structures to check.
                * **n\_children\_required** (*int*) -- The minimum number of children required to have a connection.

   :returns: A dictionary with the soma distance as key and the section as value.
   :rtype: dict

   .. seealso:: See also: :py:meth:`~get\_inner\_section\_at\_distance` that returns the closest section at a specific distance, rather than all sections beyond some distance.
