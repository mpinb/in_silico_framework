===========


.. py:function:: biophysics_fitting.utils.pool_helper(callable_partial)

   Unserialize a function and its arguments, run it, and serialize the output.


.. 
   Warning: we replace underscores with an escape backslash about 4 lines above to avoid having Sphinx interpret arguments as links.
   However, this may cause issues with code blocks or other literal text, and malform markdown tables
   Use with caution?
