get_inner_section_at_distance
=============================


.. py:function:: biophysics_fitting.utils.get_inner_section_at_distance(cell, dist, beyond_dist=1000, beyond_struct=[&#39;ApicalDendrite&#39;])

   Get sections that connect to specific structures at a particular distance.

   Fetches all sections that are connected to compartments with labels in :paramref:`beyond\_struct`, and
   that have a soma distance of :paramref:`beyond\_dist`.
   This is useful to get sections of the apical trunk of an L5PT, filtering out oblique dendrites.

   :Parameters: * **cell** (:py:class:`~single\_cell\_parser.cell.Cell`) -- The cell object.
                * **dist** (*float*) -- The distance from the soma (um).
                * **beyond\_dist** (*float*) -- The minimum distance from the soma (um).
                * **beyond\_struct** (*list*) -- The labels of the structures to check.

   :returns: The section and the relative distance from the section to the soma. Only returns the section that's closest to the provided :paramref:`dist`.
   :rtype: tuple

   .. seealso:: See also: :py:meth:`~get\_inner\_sec\_dist\_dict` that returns all sections beyond some distance, rather than only the closest section at a specific distance.
