find_crossing
=============


.. py:function:: biophysics_fitting.ephys.find_crossing(v, thresh)

   Original NEURON doc:
   Function that giving a threshold returns a list of two vectors
   The first is the crossing up of that threshold
   The second is the crossing down of that threshold

   :Parameters: * **v** (*array*) -- Voltage array.
                * **thresh** (*float*) -- Threshold voltage (mV).

   :returns: List of index vectors. One for upcrossing, one for downcrossing.
   :rtype: list

   However, this may cause issues with code blocks or other literal text, and malform markdown tables
