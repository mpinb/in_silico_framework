find_crossing_old
=================


.. py:function:: biophysics_fitting.ephys.find_crossing_old(v, thresh)

   Original NEURON doc:
   Function that giving a threshold returns a list of two vectors
   The first is the crossing up of that threshold
   The second is the crossing down of that threshold

   .. note:: Extended by Arco: returns [[],[]] if the number of crossing up vs crossing down is not equal.

   Warning: we replace underscores with an escape backslash about 4 lines above to avoid having Sphinx interpret arguments as links.
   However, this may cause issues with code blocks or other literal text, and malform markdown tables
   Use with caution?
