=============


.. py:function:: biophysics_fitting.ephys.voltage_base2(voltage_traces, t0, recSiteID=&#39;recSiteID&#39;)

   Fetch the voltage at a given time point t0 for a specific recording site ID.

   :Parameters: * **voltage\_traces** (*dict*) -- A dictionary containing voltage traces for different recording sites.
                * **recSiteID** (*int*) -- The ID of the recording site for which the voltage is to be returned.
                * **t0** (*float*) -- The time point at which the voltage is to be returned.

   :returns: The voltage at time point t0 for the specified recording site ID.
