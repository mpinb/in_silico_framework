STEP_slow_ahp_depth
===================


.. py:function:: biophysics_fitting.ephys.STEP_slow_ahp_depth(t, v, thresh=None, time_scale=5, start=1)

   Computes the average depth of the slow afterhyperpolarization (sAHP) of a voltage trace for a step stimulus.

   The sAHP is computed as the deepest point between :paramref:`timescale` after the spike and the next spike.

   .. note::

      If two consecutive spikes are less than :paramref:`timescale` apart,
      the sAHP is computed as the minimum between the first spike and the next spike,
      and there is no difference between fast and slow AHP.

   :Parameters: * **t** (*numpy.ndarray*) -- Array of time values.
                * **v** (*numpy.ndarray*) -- Array of voltage values.
                * **thresh** (*float, optional*) -- Voltage threshold for spike detection. Defaults to None.
                * **time\_scale** (*float, optional*) -- Time scale in milliseconds. Defaults to 5 ms.
                * **start** (*int*) -- Index of the first AP to be considered. Defaults to 1: Omit the first AP with index 0.

   :returns: Depth of the sAHP.
   :rtype: float
