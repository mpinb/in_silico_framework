spike_count
===========


.. py:function:: biophysics_fitting.ephys.spike_count(t, v, thresh=None)

   Counts the number of spikes in a voltage trace.

   :Parameters: * **t** (*array\_like*) -- Time values of the voltage trace, in seconds.
                * **v** (*array\_like*) -- Voltage values of the trace, in volts.
                * **thresh** (*float, optional*) -- Spike detection threshold, in volts. If not specified, the threshold
                  will be set to the mean of the voltage trace.

   :returns: The number of spikes detected in the trace.
   :rtype: int
