Simulator_Setup.check
=====================

.. py:method:: biophysics_fitting.simulator.Simulator_Setup.check()

   Check if the setup is correct.

   This method checks if the :py:class:`Simulator_Setup` object is set up correctly.

   It checks if:

   - :paramref:`cell_param_generator` is set.
   - :paramref:`cell_generator` is set.
   - The first element of the names of the :paramref:`stim_setup_funs`, :paramref:`stim_run_funs` and :paramref:`stim_response_measure_funs` are the same.
     These names are used to group the functions that belong to the same stimulus.
   - The number of :paramref:`stim_setup_funs`, :paramref:`stim_run_funs` and :paramref:`stim_response_measure_funs` are the same.
   - Calls each additional check function in :paramref:`check_funs`.
