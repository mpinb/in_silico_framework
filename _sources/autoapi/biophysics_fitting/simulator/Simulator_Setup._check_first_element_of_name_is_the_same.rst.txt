Simulator_Setup._check_first_element_of_name_is_the_same
========================================================

.. py:method:: biophysics_fitting.simulator.Simulator_Setup._check_first_element_of_name_is_the_same(list1, list2)

   Check if the first element of the names of two lists are the same.

   Note that :paramref:`list1` and :paramref:`list2` are lists of lists, where the first element of each list is
   the name of the routine, and the second element is the function associated to the routine.
   The names are thus not the function names necessarily. In general, these routine names
   are dot-separated strings that start with the stimulus they refer to e.g. ``'stim_1.setup'``.

   :Parameters: * **list1** (*list*) -- A list of function tags.
                * **list2** (*list*) -- A list of function tags.

   :raises ValueError: If the first element of the names of the two lists are not the same.
