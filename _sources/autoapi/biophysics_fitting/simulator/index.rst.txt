.. py:module:: biophysics_fitting.simulator

.. autoapi-nested-parse::
   This module concerns itself with setting up a cell with biophysical details and simulation parameters.

   The :py:class:`~biophysics_fitting.simulator.Simulator_Setup` class is an inherent attribute of the :py:class:`~biophysics_fitting.simulator.Simulator` class, and should only be accessed as such.
   It takes care of equipping a cell with biophysical details, using convenient pd.Series objects as parameter vectors.

   The class :py:class:`~biophysics_fitting.simulator.Simulator` is used to transform a parameter vector into simulated voltage traces.
   It allows to apply a variety of stimuli to the cell and extract voltage traces.

   The results of this module can be used in conjunction with :py:mod:`~biophysics_fitting.evaluator` to iteratively run and evaluate simulations.
