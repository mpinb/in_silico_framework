.. title:

robust_read_pickle
==================


.. py:function:: biophysics_fitting.exploration_from_seedpoint.RW_analysis.robust_read_pickle(path)

   Read a pickled dataframe. If it cannot be read, still return a dataframe, containing an error as content.
   Useful for when you don't want your code to error during some large-scale analysis.

   :Parameters: **path** (*str*) -- path to the pickled dataframe

   :returns: the pickled DataFrame if reading was succesful, a pd.Series otherwise. Both contain the key 'init\_error', specifying whether or not the read was succesful.
   :rtype: pd.DataFrame | pd.Series

   Warning: we replace underscores with an escape backslash about 4 lines above to avoid having Sphinx interpret arguments as links.
   However, this may cause issues with code blocks or other literal text, and malform markdown tables
   Use with caution?
