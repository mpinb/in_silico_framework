======================================


.. py:function:: biophysics_fitting.exploration_from_seedpoint.utils.evaluation_function_incremental_helper(p, s=None, e=None, cutoffs=None, stim_order=None, verbose=True, additional_evaluation_functions=None, objectives_by_stimulus=None)

   Evaluate a model shows one stimulus at a time.

   This is useful for performace, as it allows to run the fastest simulations first,
   and provides an early stopping criterion if a model is not able to match these objectives.

   :Parameters: * **s** (:py:class:`~biophysics\_fitting.simulator.Simulator`) -- Simulator object
                * **e** (:py:class:`~biophysics\_fitting.evaluator.Evaluator`) -- Evaluator object
                * **stim\_order** (*[str] | [(str)]*) -- Order in which stimuli are simulated.
                  List consisting of strings and tuples of strings.
                  Use strings if only one stimulus is to be simulated.
                  Use tuples of strings to simulate several stimuli in one go.
                * **cutoffs ({str** -- float}):
                  Keys (str) must appear in stim\_order.
                  Values (float)indicate the maximum error allowed for these stimuli
                * **objectives\_by\_stimulus ({str** -- list}):
                  Keys (str) must appear in stim\_order.
                  Values (list) are objective names returned by the evaluator object.
                * **additional\_evaluation\_functions** (*list*) -- additional functions to be applied onto the final voltage
                  traces dictionary, which return a dictionary which is appended to the
                  evaluations.

   :returns: True if all stimuli pass. False if at least one stimulus has an error above its cutoff.
