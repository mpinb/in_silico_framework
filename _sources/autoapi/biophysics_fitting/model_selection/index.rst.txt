.. These names need to match either a python object in the Python space, or (as done here) a direct link to an .rst file (without the suffix), either relative or absolute.

   Convenience methods to fetch biophysical models from a :py:class:`~data_base.data_base.DataBase`

   Biophysical models generated by the optimizer or explorer follow a specific structure in the database.
   This module provides methods to fetch models from the database, and to select the best models based on the evaluation results.
