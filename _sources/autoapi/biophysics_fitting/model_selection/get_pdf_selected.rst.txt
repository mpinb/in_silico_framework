get_pdf_selected
================


.. py:function:: biophysics_fitting.model_selection.get_pdf_selected(pdf, BAC_limit=3.5, step_limit=4.5, objectives_BAC=objectives_BAC, objectives_step=objectives_step)

   Select models based on cutoffs from a DataFrame.

   Filters the dataframe such that all models are within
   desired range of the objective, and sorts it by its
   deviation from the empirical mean.
   See :py:mod:`~biophysics\_fitting.evaluator.Evaluator` for more information
   on evaluation voltage traces.

   :Parameters: * **pdf** (*pd.DataFrame*) -- A DataFrame with model evaluations.
                * **BAC\_limit** (*float*) -- The cutoff for the BAC.
                * **step\_limit** (*float*) -- The cutoff for the step.
                * **objectives\_BAC** (*list*) -- The objectives for the BAC.
                * **objectives\_step** (*list*) -- The objectives for the step.

   :returns: A filtered DataFrame and the model\_id of the best model.
