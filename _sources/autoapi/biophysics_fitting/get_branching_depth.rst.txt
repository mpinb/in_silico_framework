get_branching_depth
===================


.. py:function:: biophysics_fitting.get_branching_depth(cell, sec, beyond_dist=1000)

   Given a Cell object and a section number, this method returns the branching depth (i.e. branching order) of that section.
   It counts the amount of sections that have children beyond some distance :paramref:`beyond\_dist` inbetween the soma and the given section :paramref:`sec`.

   If this number is 0, that means that the given section, and all its parent sections up to the soma,
   have no children (that exceed a distance to soma of :paramref:`beyond\_dist`).

   :Parameters: * **cell** (:py:class:`~single\_cell\_parser.cell.Cell`) -- The Cell object
                * **sec** (*int*) -- The section number

   :returns: Amount of sections between :paramref:`sec` and soma that have at least 2 children that are further from the soma than :paramref:`beyond\_dist`
   :rtype: int
