get_main_bifurcation_section
============================


.. py:function:: biophysics_fitting.get_main_bifurcation_section(cell)

   Find the main bifurcation of a cell.
   This is the unique inner section whose branching depth is 1.
   In some morphologies, this section is unique, and no other sections are inner sections with branching depth 1.
   This is True for e.g. pyramidal cells with an apical dendrite.

   :Parameters: * **cell** (:py:class:`~single\_cell\_parser.cell.Cell`) -- The Cell object for which to find the main bifurcation section.
                * **assert\_unique** (*bool, optional*) -- whether or not to check if this section is unique in the morphology.
                  Default: True

   :raises AssertionError: If there are multiple sections who are both inner, and have branching depth 1. This means that there is no "main" bifurcation in the morphology.

   :returns: The unique section that contains the main bifurcation.
   :rtype: :py:class:`~single\_cell\_parser.cell.PySection`
