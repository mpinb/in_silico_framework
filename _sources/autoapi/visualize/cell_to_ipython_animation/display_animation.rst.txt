.. py:function:: visualize.cell_to_ipython_animation.display_animation(files, interval=10, style=False, animID=None, embedded=False)

   Creates an IPython animation out of files specified in a globstring or a list of paths.

   :Parameters: * **files** (*str | list*) -- globstring or list of paths
                * **interval** (*int*) -- time interval between frames
                * **style** (*bool*) -- whether to use the style specified in the system default html\_template.
                * **animID** -- unique integer to identify the animation in the javascript environment of IPython
                * **embedde** (*bool*) -- whether to embed the images as base64 in the html file.

   .. attention::

      The paths need to be relative to the location of the ipynb / html file, since
      the are resolved in the browser and not by python

   :returns: the animation object
