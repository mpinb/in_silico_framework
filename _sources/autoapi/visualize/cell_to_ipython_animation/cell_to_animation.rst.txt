cell_to_animation
=================


.. py:function:: visualize.cell_to_ipython_animation.cell_to_animation(cell, xlim=None, ylim=None, tstart=245, tend=310, tstep=1, range_vars=&#39;Vm&#39;, plot_synaptic_input=False, outdir=&#39;animation&#39;)

   Takes a cell object and creates a 2d animation plotting the range\_vars vs soma distance over time.

   :Parameters: * **outdir** (*str*) -- folder, where animation should be saved. The result will be .png files.
                * **xlim** (*tuple*) -- tuple like (0, 1600) that defines the limits of the x axis.
                  If None, tries to get default values for range var from get\_default\_axis
                  Default: None.
                * **ylim** (*tuple*) -- tuple like (-80 0) that defines the limits of the y axis
                  If None, tries to get default values for range var from get\_default\_axis
                  Default: None.
                * **tstart** (*float*) -- time when animation should be started
                * **tend** (*float*) -- time when animation should be stopped
                * **tstep** (*float*) -- timestep between frames
                * **range\_vars** (*str | list*) -- str or list of str: range vars to display, default: 'Vm'

   :returns: list of paths to images
   :rtype: list
