CMVDataParser._calc_morphology
==============================

.. py:method:: visualize.cell_morphology_visualizer.CMVDataParser._calc_morphology(cell)

   Retrieve cell morphology from cell object.

   Retrieves all points of the cell morphology from the cell object.
   In addition, it keeps track of parent sections.
   Fills the following attributes:

   - self._morphology_unconnected: a pandas DataFrame containing point information, diameter and section ID WITHOUT duplicated points for branchpoints for connections between sections.
   - self.morphology: a pandas DataFrame containing point information, diameter and section ID WITHOUT duplicated points for branchpoints for connections between sections. Same as above, but publically accessible.
   - self._morphology_connected: a pandas DataFrame containing point information, diameter and section ID WITH duplicated points for branchpoints for connections between sections. Same as above, but with branchpoints connected to the parent section.
   - self.sections: an array of unique section indices.
   - self.n_sections: number of sections in the cell.
   - self.parents: a dictionary that maps sections to their parents. self.parents[10] returns the parent of section 10.

   :Parameters: **cell** -- Cell object

   :returns: Nothing. Updates the attributes mentioned above.
