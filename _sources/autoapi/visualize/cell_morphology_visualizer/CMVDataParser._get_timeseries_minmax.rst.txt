CMVDataParser._get_timeseries_minmax
====================================

.. py:method:: visualize.cell_morphology_visualizer.CMVDataParser._get_timeseries_minmax(timeseries)

   Get the min and max values of a timeseries that is nested per section and timepoint.
   Timeseries have three axes: time, section_id, section_point. Each timeseries[time][section_id] shows values for all points in that section at that time.
   Getting minmax of nested lists can be annoying, hence this method.

   :Parameters: **timeseries** (*list*) -- List of lists of lists. Each element of the list is a list of data for that section at that time. Shape: (n_times, n_sections, n_points_in_section)

   :returns: min and max for some timeseries across all timepoints and sections.
   :rtype: tuple
