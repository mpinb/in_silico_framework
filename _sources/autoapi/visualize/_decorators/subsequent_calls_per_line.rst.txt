subsequent_calls_per_line
=========================


.. py:function:: visualize._decorators.subsequent_calls_per_line(plotfun)

   Call a function on each row of a dataframe separately.

   Useful for plotfunctions that are designed to operate on :py:class:`pandas.Series` instances,
   rather than on :py:class:`pandas.DataFrame` instances.
   Also useful for parallelizing plotting functions.

   The first input argument (i.e. ``args[0]``) is assumed to be an pd.DataFrame instance.

   If the first n args are of type :py:class:`pandas.DataFrame`, each frame
   will be iterated as described above.
   In this case, it is assumed that all n DataFrames have the same indexes.

   :Parameters: **plotfun** -- The function to decorate.

   :returns: a function that calls ``plotfun`` on each row of the DataFrame(s).
   :rtype: Callable

   Use with caution?
