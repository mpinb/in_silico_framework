.. py:function:: visualize.voltage_trace_visualizer.plot_vt(voltage_traces, key=&#39;BAC.hay_measure&#39;)

   Plot voltage traces from simulation results.

   The results of e.g. :py:class:`biophysics\_fitting.simulator.Simulator` are nested dictionaries,
   containing various voltage traces. NEURON simulation results are NEURON vectors.
   This is a helper method to extract that data and plot out specific voltage traces from those results.

   :Parameters: * **voltage\_traces** (*dict*) -- dictionary containing the voltage traces.
                * **key** (*str*) -- key to access the specific voltage trace to plot.

   :returns: None
