NetworkMapper._map_complete_anatomical_realization
==================================================

.. py:method:: single_cell_parser.network.NetworkMapper._map_complete_anatomical_realization(weights=None, full_network=False)

   Connect synapses to active presynaptic cells.

   This is step 4 in the creation of a saved network using :py:meth:`create_saved_network2`.
   The synapses should already be created in :py:meth:`_assign_anatomical_synapses` (step 1),
   the presynaptic cells have been created in :py:meth:`_create_presyn_cells` (step 2),
   and their activity should have been generated in :py:meth:`_activate_presyn_cells` (step 3).

   Assigns synapse weights using :py:meth:`~_assign_synapse_weights` and connect synapses to presynaptic cells with defined activity.

   :Parameters: * **weights** (*dict | None, optional*) -- pecific weights for each synapse type.
                  Default: None, in which case they are read from the :ref:`network_parameters_format`.
                * **full_network** (*bool*) -- Defines which cell IDS to use.
                  If True: (non-sequential) cell ids from the network embedding are used.
                  If False, single_cell network embedding from single_cell_input_mapper is used, in which cell ids are sequential.
