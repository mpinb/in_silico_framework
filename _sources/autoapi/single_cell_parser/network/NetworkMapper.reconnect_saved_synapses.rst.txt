NetworkMapper.reconnect_saved_synapses
======================================

.. py:method:: single_cell_parser.network.NetworkMapper.reconnect_saved_synapses(synInfoName, synWeightName=None, include_silent_synapses=False)

   Set up a network from a saved :ref:`syn_activation_format` file.

   This method does not only create the synapse locations from previously saved files,
   but also activates them according to the saved activation times.
   This is in contrast to e.g. :py:meth:`~create_saved_network2`, which generates
   the activations from scratch.

   :Parameters: * **synInfoName** (*str*) -- Name of the :ref:`syn_activation_format` file.
                * **synWeightName** (*str, optional*) -- Name of the file containing the synapse weights. Default: None.
                * **include_silent_synapses** -- Also create synapses that were not active.
                  This maintains the synapse id, but maybe slightly slower.

   .. deprecated:: 0.1
      The ``synWeightName`` argument is deprecated.
