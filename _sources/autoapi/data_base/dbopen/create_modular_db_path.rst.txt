create_modular_db_path
======================


.. py:function:: data_base.dbopen.create_modular_db_path(path)

   Create a database path from a given path.

   Modular database paths are of the form ``mdb://<unique\_id>/...``.
   The point of these paths is to be independent of their location on the hard drive,
   and can thus be transferred to other file systems, and resolved afterwards using the database registry.

   :Parameters: **path** (*str*) -- The path to be converted to a database path.

   :returns: The database path.
   :rtype: str


.. 
   Warning: we replace underscores with an escape backslash about 4 lines above to avoid having Sphinx interpret arguments as links.
   However, this may cause issues with code blocks or other literal text, and malform markdown tables
   Use with caution?
