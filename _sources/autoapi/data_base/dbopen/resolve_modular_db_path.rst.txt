resolve_modular_db_path
=======================


.. py:function:: data_base.dbopen.resolve_modular_db_path(path)

   Resolve the path of a database.

   Modular database paths are filepaths of the form ``mdb://<unique\_id>/...``.
   These are used to be independent of the location of the database on the hard drive.
   This has been useful for migrating data between different file systems.
   These relative paths are registered to an actual path in the data base registry upon creation.
   Migrating databases then consists of simply re-registering the database to the new location.

   This method checks the current registry for the absolute path of the database on the current filesystem.

   :Parameters: **path** (*str*) -- The path to resolve.

   :returns: The resolved path.
   :rtype: str
