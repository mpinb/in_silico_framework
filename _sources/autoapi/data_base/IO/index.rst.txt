.. These names need to match either a python object in the Python space, or (as done here) a direct link to an .rst file (without the suffix), either relative or absolute.

.. py:module:: data_base.IO

.. autoapi-nested-parse::
   Dynamic IO package for saving and loading data across file formats and data types.

   This is a wrapper package for one of (currently) two possible database backends:

   - :py:mod:`data_base.isf_data_base.IO` (default, highly recommended)
   - :py:mod:`data_base.model_data_base.IO` (strongly discouraged)

   The former uses JSON for saving metadata and file format information.

   The latter used the `.pickle` format for this, which made the saved data fragile to source code API changes, even internal. For this reason it has been
   deprecated, and its use is discouraged. The only reason why it is still here is for backwards compatibility.
