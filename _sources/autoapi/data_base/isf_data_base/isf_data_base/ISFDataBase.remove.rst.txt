ISFDataBase.remove
==================

.. py:method:: data_base.isf_data_base.isf_data_base.ISFDataBase.remove()

   Deletes the database.

   Deletes the entire database from disk in the background and de-registers itself from the register as soon as it is deleted.

   .. note::

      This method is not a destructor, nor equivalent to ``__del__`` or ``__delete__``, which would simply remove it from memory.
      It does not get called during garbage collection, when the object goes out of scope, or when the program terminates.
      It should be explicitly called by the user when the user likes to delete a database.
