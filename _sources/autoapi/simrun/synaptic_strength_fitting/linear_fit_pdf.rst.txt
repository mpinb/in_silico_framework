.. py:function:: simrun.synaptic_strength_fitting.linear_fit_pdf(pdf)

   Calculate linear fits between the synaptic conductance and the EPSP.

   This method calculates the mean and offset of a linear fit between gAMPA and the following statistics of the EPSP:

   - mean
   - standard deviation
   - median
   - maximum

   Is used to calculate per-celltype conductance values that match empirical data.

   :Parameters: **pdf** (*pd.DataFrame*) -- A table of summary statistics, as returned by :py:meth:`~simrun.synaptic\_strength\_fitting.ePSP\_summary\_statistics`,
                but without an index.

   :returns: A table of linear fits.
   :rtype: pd.Series
