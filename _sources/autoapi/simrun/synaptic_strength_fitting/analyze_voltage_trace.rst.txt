=====================


.. py:function:: simrun.synaptic_strength_fitting.analyze_voltage_trace(vTrace, tTrace)

   Calculate a voltage trace's extremum and time point thereof.

   :Parameters: * **vTrace** (*np.array*) -- Voltage trace.
                * **tTrace** (*np.array*) -- Timepoints of the voltage trace.

   :returns: Timepoint and amplitude of the maximum voltage deflection.
   :rtype: tuple
