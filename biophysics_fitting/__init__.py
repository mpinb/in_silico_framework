"""
This package contains code to generate and analyze biophysically detailed multi-compartmental models (MCM).

It provides two ways to generate mutli-compartmental models:

    1. [BluePyOpt](https://github.com/BlueBrain/BluePyOpt) :cite:`Van_Geit_Gevaert_Chindemi_Rössert_Courcol_Muller_Schürmann_Segev_Markram_2016`, a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA): :py:mod:`biophysics_fitting.MOEA_EH_minimal`.
    2. An exploration algorithm: :py:mod:`biophysics_fitting.exploration_from_seedpoint`.

The MOEA does not require any a priori assumptions on biophysical parameters to find a MCM, but fails to explore the full diversity of possible MCMs. 
On the other hand, the exploration approach can explore the full diversity of possible biophysical models, but also requires a MCM as a seedpoint in order to start. 
If you need to generate models from scratch, we recommend using the MOEA algorithm to find at least a single model, and then using this as a seedpoint for the exploration algorithm.
