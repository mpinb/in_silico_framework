class Evaluator:
    '''Extract features from voltage traces.
    
    This  class can be used to extract features from (usually) voltage traces
    of different stimuli. The voltage traces are (usually) computed with a Simulator 
    object by calling its run method.
    
    In an optimization the features returned by Evaluator.evaluate are saved together
    with to corresponding parameter values.
    
    For a Simulator object s and a Evaluator object e, the typical usecase is::
    
        voltage_traces_dict = s.run(params)
        features = e.evaluate(voltage_traces_dict)
            
    The workflow in the Evaluator can be split in two parts:
    
        1. for each key in the :paramref:`voltage_traces_dict`:
            apply `evaluate_fun`, that is registered with a name that matches the key.
            Extracts features from the voltage trace.
        2. perform arbitrary operations on the resulting dictionary 
            (e.g. merge it from a nested to a flat dictionary or compute more complex features
            by combineing features from different stimuli)
            
    An example set up can be found in :mod:`~bipohysics_fitting.hay_complete_default_setup`.
    
    Example: 
        
        >>> def examplary_evaluate_fun(**kwargs):
        >>>    # kwargs are keys and values of voltage_traces_dict[in_name]
        >>>    # extract features from kwargs
        >>>    return out_dict # keys are names of features, values are features

        >>> def finalize_fun(dict_):
        >>>   # dict_ is a dictionary with out_name of the evaluate_funs as keys.
        >>>    # and the returned dictionary out_dict as values, 
        >>>    # i.e. out_dict is a nested dictionary.
        >>>    # dict_ can now be arbitrarily modified, e.g. flattened.
        >>>    return modified_dict

        >>> e = Evaluator()
        >>> e.setup.evaluate_funs.append([in_name, evaluate_fun, out_name])  # corresponds to step (1)
        >>> e.setup.finalize_funs.append(finalize_fun)  # corresponds to step (2)

    Note: 
        Combining features to reduce the number of objectives should be done with the Combiner object.

        Details on how to set up the Evaluator are in the docstring of the Evaluator class.

        Args:
            features_dict (dict): a dictionary of stimulus names as keys, and corresponding voltage traces as values.
            raise_ (bool): Whether or not to raise an error if the required voltage trace is not in `features_dict.keys()`. 
                If False, will not raise an error, and evaluate all features that can be evaluated given the provided `features_dict`. 

        Raises:
            KeyError: if the Evaluator tries to evaluate a trace with a name that is not present in `features_dict.keys()` and raise_ is set to True

        Returns:
            obj: Whatever the return value is of :py:attr:`Evaluator.setup.finalize_funs`. 
            Usually, this is the output of :meth:`~biophysics_fitting.hay_evaluation_default_complete_setup_python.get_Evaluator`,
