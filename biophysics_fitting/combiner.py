This module provides the :class:`Combiner` class and associated classes and functions.
The :class:`~biophysics_fitting.combiner.Combiner` class can be used to combine features computed by an :class:`~biophysics_fitting.evaluator.Evaluator` object.

class Combiner:
    '''
    This  class can be used to combine features (usually) computed by an :class:`Evaluator` object.
    
    For a :class:`Simulator` object s, an :class:`E`valuator object e, and a :class:`Combiner` object c, the typical usecase is:
    
        >>> voltage_traces_dict = s.run(params)
        >>> features = e.evaluate(voltage_traces_dict)
        >>> combined_features = c.combine(features)
            
    Internally, the Combiner iterates over all names of specified combinations. 
    Each combination is specified not only by a name of the combination, 
    but also a list of names of the features that go into that combination. 
    Each list of features is then combined by calling combinefun with that list.
    
    Example: Assume, the evaluator returns a dictionary like::
    
        features = {'feature1': 1, 'feature2': 2, 'feature3': 3, 'feature4': 4}
        
    We want to combine feature1 and 2. 
    We also want to combine features2, 3 and 4. 
    Combining features should be done by taking the maximum.
    
    How can this be set up?
    An example, how the Combiner object can be set up can be found in :py:mod:`~biophysics_fitting.hay_complete_default_setup`
    
        c = Combiner()
        c.setup.append('combination1', ['feature1', 'feature2'])
        c.setup.append('combination2', ['feature2', 'feature3', 'feature4'])
        c.setup.combinefun = max
        
        combined_features = c.combine(features)
        combined_features
        > {'combination1': 2, 'combination2': 4}
