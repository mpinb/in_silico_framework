This module provides the :class:`Combiner` class and associated classes and functions.
The :class:`~biophysics_fitting.combiner.Combiner` class can be used to combine features computed by an :class:`~biophysics_fitting.evaluator.Evaluator` object.

class Combiner:
    '''
    This class can be used to combine features (usually) computed by an :class:`~biophysics_fitting.evaluator.Evaluator` object.
    
    For a :class:`~biophysics_fitting.simulator.Simulator` object `s`, an :class:`~biophysics_fitting.evaluator.Evaluator` object `e`, and a :class:`~biophysics_fitting.combiner.Combiner` object `c`, the typical usecase is:
    
        >>> voltage_traces_dict = s.run(params)
        >>> features = e.evaluate(voltage_traces_dict)
        >>> combined_features = c.combine(features)
            
    Internally, the Combiner iterates over all names of specified combinations. 
    Each combination is specified not only by a name of the combination, 
    but also a list of names of the features that go into that combination. 
    Each list of features is then combined by calling combinefun with that list.
    
    Example:
    
        >>> features = {'feature1': 1, 'feature2': 2, 'feature3': 3, 'feature4': 4}
        >>> c = Combiner()
        >>> c.setup.append('combination1', ['feature1', 'feature2'])
        >>> c.setup.append('combination2', ['feature2', 'feature3', 'feature4'])
        >>> c.setup.combinefun = max
        >>> combined_features = c.combine(features)
        >>> combined_features
        {'combination1': 2, 'combination2': 4}
