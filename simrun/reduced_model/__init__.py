From times where Arco used LDA to extract kernels.

However, this scratched the computational limits when trying to add spatial information. 
For this reason, this reduced modeling approach has been extended into :py:mod:`simrun.modular_reduced_model_inference`
so that it can be modularized and parallellized better.
