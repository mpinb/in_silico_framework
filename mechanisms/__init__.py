"""
This directory contains the `.mod` files that define the biophysical behaviour of ion channels, such as conductivity, states, derivative states and initial conditions. 
In addition, it contains network connectivity parameters that define e.g. synaptic connections.

These are used by the NEURON simulator as variable parameters for solving the partial differential equations that describe the biophysics of a neuron.
