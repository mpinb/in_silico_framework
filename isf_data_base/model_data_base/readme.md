# ModelDataBase

ModelDataBase is the data management system originally devised to store data in the IBS group, authored by Arco Bast. Due to file format deprecation issues, it needed to be rewritten. The result of this is the [isf_data_base](../__init__.py) package.

The ModuleDataBase package is kept around for compatibility with old data of the IBS group in MPINB, Bonn. It should not be used by anyone else.
