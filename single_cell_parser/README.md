# Single Cell Parser

This module provides the main methods of interacting with NEURON or Amira files in Python. It contains methods for parsing cell data, such as morphology and membrane properties; methods for converting cellular data to other formats; applying synapses to a cell morphology given certain biological constraints (see [synapse_mapper](./synapse_mapper.py) and [synapse](./synapse.py)) etc...
