# Coordinated Views â€” A Grammar-based Approach
## About

Supports the creation of web-based data analytics dashboards consisting of linked views. Key features:
- Integrate different JavaScript visualization libraries (e.g., Vega-Lite, Plotly.js, Babylon.js)
- Thereby enable combination of InfoVis (e.g., scatter plot, parallel coordinates) and 3D views
- Specify layout and interactions with a JSON-based grammar


## Running the application

### 1a. Interactive usage with jupyter notebooks
Start backend server in jupyter notebook (use Python 3.8 environment of In-Silico-Framework as kernel, see [setup instructions](../../installer/README.md)). 
```
example_vaex.ipynb
```

### 1b. Legacy mode (standalone Python server as in paper)
Navigate to this folder, activate Python 3.8 environment of In-Silico-Framework (see [setup instructions](../../installer/README.md)), and start data server from command line.
```
source_3
python server.py ../../getting_started/linked-views-example-data/case_study_1
```
Replace `case_study_1` with `case_study_2` to view the second case study from the paper (excluding membrane potentials).



### 2. Start web-based frontend
Please refer to the [documentation](frontend/README.md) in the frontend folder.
