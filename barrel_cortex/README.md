# Barrel Cortex

This module contains barrel cortex specific code and data:

    - average_barrel_field_L45_border.am: barrel cortex geometry, to be rendered in AMIRA
    - barrel_cortex.py: contains functions specific to barrel cortex simulations, such as synaptic strength readout, methods to move morphologies in barrel cortex...
