"""Initialisation file for the barrel_cortex module

This module should contain everything that's related to the entire barrel cortex.
It includes:
    - average_barrel_field_L45_border.am: barrel cortex geometry, to be rendered in AMIRA
    - barrel_cortex.py: contains functions specific to barrel cortex simulations, such as synaptic strength readout, methods to move morphologies in barrel cortex...
