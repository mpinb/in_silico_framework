ISF is a multi-scale simulation environment for the generation, simulation, and analysis of neurobiologically tractable single cell and network-level simulations.
It allows for targeted and mechanistically detailed *in silico* manipulations across multiple scales, from the molecular to the network level, and provides a toolkit for the integration of experimental data and models.

ISF can generally be categorized in three main workflows, each constrained with empirical data. Each workflow links to an associated tutorial. At the end, ISF provides 
a diverse collection of empirically constrained, yet biologically diverse multi-scale models, that provide concrete and testable predictions, and are intended to guide further experiments
