The In-Silico Framework (ISF)
=============================

ISF is a multi-scale simulation environment for the generation, simulation, and analysis of neurobiologically tractable single cell and network-level simulations.
It allows for targeted and mechanistically detailed *in-silico* manipulations across multiple scales, from the molecular to the network level, and provides a toolkit for the integration of experimental data and models.
