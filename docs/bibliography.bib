abstractNote={Pyramidal tract neurons (PTs) represent the major output cell type of the mammalian neocortex. Here, we report the origins of the PTs’ ability to respond to a broad range of stimuli with onset latencies that rival or even precede those of their intracortical input neurons. We find that neurons with extensive horizontally projecting axons cluster around the deep-layer terminal fields of primary thalamocortical axons. The strategic location of these corticocortical neurons results in high convergence of thalamocortical inputs, which drive reliable sensory-evoked responses that precede those in other excitatory cell types. The resultant fast and horizontal stream of excitation provides PTs throughout the cortical area with input that acts to amplify additional inputs from thalamocortical and other intracortical populations. The fast onsets and broadly tuned characteristics of PT responses hence reflect a gating mechanism in the deep layers, which assures that sensory-evoked input can be reliably transformed into cortical output.},

Investigation of structural organization principles or quantification of dendritic and axonal innervation thus requires integration of many reconstructed morphologies into a common reference frame. Here we present a standardized 3D model of the rat vibrissal cortex and introduce an automated registration tool that allows for precise placement of single neuron reconstructions. We (1) developed an automated image processing pipeline to reconstruct 3D anatomical landmarks, i.e., the barrels in Layer 4, the pia and white matter surfaces and the blood vessel pattern from high-resolution images, (2) quantified these landmarks in 12 different rats, (3) generated an average 3D model of the vibrissal cortex and (4) used rigid transformations and stepwise linear scaling to register 94 neuron morphologies, reconstructed from in vivo stainings, to the standardized cortex model. We find that anatomical landmarks vary substantially across the vibrissal cortex within an individual rat. In contrast, the 3D layout of the entire vibrissal cortex remains remarkably preserved across animals. This allows for precise registration of individual neuron reconstructions with approximately 30 um accuracy. Our approach could be used to reconstruct and standardize other anatomically defined brain areas and may ultimately lead to a precise digital reference atlas of the rat brain.}, number={12}, journal={PLOS Computational Biology}, publisher={Public Library of Science}, author={Egger, Robert and Narayanan, Rajeevan T. and Helmstaedter, Moritz and Kock, Christiaan P.

L5b pyramidal cells have been the subject of extensive experimental and modeling studies, yet conductance-based models of these cells that faithfully reproduce both their perisomatic Na+-spiking behavior as well as key dendritic active properties, including Ca2+ spikes and back-propagating action potentials, are still lacking. Based on a large body of experimental recordings from both the soma and dendrites of L5b pyramidal cells in adult rats, we characterized key features of the somatic and dendritic firing and quantified their statistics. We used these features to constrain the density of a set of ion channels over the soma and dendritic surface via multi-objective optimization with an evolutionary algorithm, thus generating a set of detailed conductance-based models that faithfully replicate the back-propagating action potential activated Ca2+ spike firing and the perisomatic firing response to current steps, as well as the experimental variability of the properties. Furthermore, we show a useful way to analyze model parameters with our sets of models, which enabled us to identify some of the mechanisms responsible for the dynamic properties of L5b pyramidal cells as well as mechanisms that are sensitive to morphological changes. This automated framework can be used to develop a database of faithful models for other neuron types. The models we present provide several experimentally-testable predictions and can serve as a powerful tool for theoretical investigations of the contribution of single-cell dynamics to network activity and its computational capabilities.}, number={7}, journal={PLOS Computational Biology}, publisher={Public Library of Science}, author={Hay, Etay and Hill, Sean and Schuermann, Felix and Markram, Henry and Segev, Idan}, year={2011}, month=jul, pages={e1002107}, language={en} }

Parameterizing such models to conform to the multitude of available experimental constraints is a global non-linear optimisation problem with a complex fitness landscape, requiring numerical techniques to find suitable approximate solutions. Stochastic optimisation approaches, such as evolutionary algorithms, have been shown to be effective, but often the setting up of such optimisations and the choice of a specific search algorithm and its parameters is non-trivial, requiring domain-specific expertise. Here we describe BluePyOpt, a Python package targeted at the broad neuroscience community to simplify this task. BluePyOpt is an extensible framework for data-driven model parameter optimisation that wraps and standardizes several existing open-source tools. It simplifies the task of creating and sharing these optimisations, and the associated techniques and knowledge. This is achieved by abstracting the optimisation and evaluation tasks into various reusable and flexible discrete elements according to established best-practices. Further, BluePyOpt provides methods for setting up both small- and large-scale optimisations on a variety of platforms, ranging from laptops to Linux clusters and cloud-based compute infrastructures. The versatility of the BluePyOpt framework is demonstrated by working through three representative neuroscience specific use cases.}, journal={Frontiers in Neuroinformatics}, author={Van Geit, Werner and Gevaert, Michael and Chindemi, Giuseppe and Roessert, Christian and Courcol, Jean-Denis and Muller, Eilif B. and Schuermann, Felix and Segev, Idan and Markram, Henry}, year={2016}, month=jun, pages={17} }

It has been suggested that in the distal apical dendrite of layer 5B (L5B) neocortical pyramidal neurones, K+ conductances participate in active dendritic synaptic integration and control regenerative dendritic potentials. The ionic mechanism for triggering these regenerative potentials has yet to be elucidated. Here we used two-electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) to quantitatively record K+ conductance densities of a sustained K+ conductance in the soma and apical dendrite of L5B neurones of adult rats. We report that the somatic and proximal dendritic sustained voltage-gated K+ conductance density is more than 10-fold larger than previous estimates. The results obtained using TEVC were corroborated using current-clamp experiments in combination with compartmental modelling. Possible error sources, including inaccurate measurement of the passive membrane parameters and unknown axonal and basal dendritic conductance distributions, were shown not to distort the density estimation considerably. The sustained voltage-gated K+ conductance density was found to decrease steeply along the apical dendrite. The steep negative K+ conductance density gradient along the apical dendrite may help to define a distal, low-threshold region for amplification of distal synaptic input in L5B pyramidal neurones.}, number={Pt 3}, journal={The Journal of Physiology}, author={Schaefer, Andreas T and Helmstaedter, Moritz and Schmitt, Arno C and Bar-Yehuda, Dan and Almog, Mara and Ben-Porat, Hana and Sakmann, Bert and Korngreen, Alon}, year={2007}, month=mar, pages={737–752} }
