abstractNote={Pyramidal tract neurons (PTs) represent the major output cell type of the mammalian neocortex. Here, we report the origins of the PTs’ ability to respond to a broad range of stimuli with onset latencies that rival or even precede those of their intracortical input neurons. We find that neurons with extensive horizontally projecting axons cluster around the deep-layer terminal fields of primary thalamocortical axons. The strategic location of these corticocortical neurons results in high convergence of thalamocortical inputs, which drive reliable sensory-evoked responses that precede those in other excitatory cell types. The resultant fast and horizontal stream of excitation provides PTs throughout the cortical area with input that acts to amplify additional inputs from thalamocortical and other intracortical populations. The fast onsets and broadly tuned characteristics of PT responses hence reflect a gating mechanism in the deep layers, which assures that sensory-evoked input can be reliably transformed into cortical output.},

Investigation of structural organization principles or quantification of dendritic and axonal innervation thus requires integration of many reconstructed morphologies into a common reference frame. Here we present a standardized 3D model of the rat vibrissal cortex and introduce an automated registration tool that allows for precise placement of single neuron reconstructions. We (1) developed an automated image processing pipeline to reconstruct 3D anatomical landmarks, i.e., the barrels in Layer 4, the pia and white matter surfaces and the blood vessel pattern from high-resolution images, (2) quantified these landmarks in 12 different rats, (3) generated an average 3D model of the vibrissal cortex and (4) used rigid transformations and stepwise linear scaling to register 94 neuron morphologies, reconstructed from in vivo stainings, to the standardized cortex model. We find that anatomical landmarks vary substantially across the vibrissal cortex within an individual rat. In contrast, the 3D layout of the entire vibrissal cortex remains remarkably preserved across animals. This allows for precise registration of individual neuron reconstructions with approximately 30 um accuracy. Our approach could be used to reconstruct and standardize other anatomically defined brain areas and may ultimately lead to a precise digital reference atlas of the rat brain.}, number={12}, journal={PLOS Computational Biology}, publisher={Public Library of Science}, author={Egger, Robert and Narayanan, Rajeevan T. and Helmstaedter, Moritz and Kock, Christiaan P.

L5b pyramidal cells have been the subject of extensive experimental and modeling studies, yet conductance-based models of these cells that faithfully reproduce both their perisomatic Na+-spiking behavior as well as key dendritic active properties, including Ca2+ spikes and back-propagating action potentials, are still lacking. Based on a large body of experimental recordings from both the soma and dendrites of L5b pyramidal cells in adult rats, we characterized key features of the somatic and dendritic firing and quantified their statistics. We used these features to constrain the density of a set of ion channels over the soma and dendritic surface via multi-objective optimization with an evolutionary algorithm, thus generating a set of detailed conductance-based models that faithfully replicate the back-propagating action potential activated Ca2+ spike firing and the perisomatic firing response to current steps, as well as the experimental variability of the properties. Furthermore, we show a useful way to analyze model parameters with our sets of models, which enabled us to identify some of the mechanisms responsible for the dynamic properties of L5b pyramidal cells as well as mechanisms that are sensitive to morphological changes. This automated framework can be used to develop a database of faithful models for other neuron types. The models we present provide several experimentally-testable predictions and can serve as a powerful tool for theoretical investigations of the contribution of single-cell dynamics to network activity and its computational capabilities.}, number={7}, journal={PLOS Computational Biology}, publisher={Public Library of Science}, author={Hay, Etay and Hill, Sean and Schuermann, Felix and Markram, Henry and Segev, Idan}, year={2011}, month=jul, pages={e1002107}, language={en} }

Parameterizing such models to conform to the multitude of available experimental constraints is a global non-linear optimisation problem with a complex fitness landscape, requiring numerical techniques to find suitable approximate solutions. Stochastic optimisation approaches, such as evolutionary algorithms, have been shown to be effective, but often the setting up of such optimisations and the choice of a specific search algorithm and its parameters is non-trivial, requiring domain-specific expertise. Here we describe BluePyOpt, a Python package targeted at the broad neuroscience community to simplify this task. BluePyOpt is an extensible framework for data-driven model parameter optimisation that wraps and standardizes several existing open-source tools. It simplifies the task of creating and sharing these optimisations, and the associated techniques and knowledge. This is achieved by abstracting the optimisation and evaluation tasks into various reusable and flexible discrete elements according to established best-practices. Further, BluePyOpt provides methods for setting up both small- and large-scale optimisations on a variety of platforms, ranging from laptops to Linux clusters and cloud-based compute infrastructures. The versatility of the BluePyOpt framework is demonstrated by working through three representative neuroscience specific use cases.}, journal={Frontiers in Neuroinformatics}, author={Van Geit, Werner and Gevaert, Michael and Chindemi, Giuseppe and Roessert, Christian and Courcol, Jean-Denis and Muller, Eilif B. and Schuermann, Felix and Segev, Idan and Markram, Henry}, year={2016}, month=jun, pages={17} }

It has been suggested that in the distal apical dendrite of layer 5B (L5B) neocortical pyramidal neurones, K+ conductances participate in active dendritic synaptic integration and control regenerative dendritic potentials. The ionic mechanism for triggering these regenerative potentials has yet to be elucidated. Here we used two-electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) to quantitatively record K+ conductance densities of a sustained K+ conductance in the soma and apical dendrite of L5B neurones of adult rats. We report that the somatic and proximal dendritic sustained voltage-gated K+ conductance density is more than 10-fold larger than previous estimates. The results obtained using TEVC were corroborated using current-clamp experiments in combination with compartmental modelling. Possible error sources, including inaccurate measurement of the passive membrane parameters and unknown axonal and basal dendritic conductance distributions, were shown not to distort the density estimation considerably. The sustained voltage-gated K+ conductance density was found to decrease steeply along the apical dendrite. The steep negative K+ conductance density gradient along the apical dendrite may help to define a distal, low-threshold region for amplification of distal synaptic input in L5B pyramidal neurones.}, number={Pt 3}, journal={The Journal of Physiology}, author={Schaefer, Andreas T and Helmstaedter, Moritz and Schmitt, Arno C and Bar-Yehuda, Dan and Almog, Mara and Ben-Porat, Hana and Sakmann, Bert and Korngreen, Alon}, year={2007}, month=mar, pages={737–752} }

 abstractNote={Perception is linked to a calcium-dependent dendritic spiking mechanism that enables the major output cells of the cerebral cortex – layer 5 pyramidal tract neurons – to combine inputs from different information streams. Which circuits activate this mechanism upon sensory input is unclear. Here we found that thalamocortical axons, which provide sensory input to cortex, target specifically the dendritic domains in pyramidal tract neurons that initiate calcium spikes. Sensory input thereby enables distal dendritic inputs preceding the stimulus to transform the first responses that leave cortex into bursts of action potentials. Thus, thalamus can drive active dendritic coupling of sensory with prestimulus information streams to modulate cortical output. Our findings indicate that thalamocortical coupling is first in a cascade of mechanisms that transform sensory input into perception.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Measurements of synaptic innervation, connection probabilities and subcellular organization of synaptic inputs are thus among the most active fields of research in contemporary neuroscience. Methods to measure these quantities range from electrophysiological recordings over reconstructions of dendrite-axon overlap at light-microscopic levels to dense circuit reconstructions of small volumes at electron-microscopic resolution. However, quantitative and complete measurements at subcellular resolution and mesoscopic scales to obtain all local and long-range synaptic in/outputs for any neuron within an entire brain region are beyond present methodological limits. Here, we present a novel concept, implemented within an interactive software environment called NeuroNet, which allows (i) integration of sparsely sampled (sub)cellular morphological data into an accurate anatomical reference frame of the brain region(s) of interest, (ii) up-scaling to generate an average dense model of the neuronal circuitry within the respective brain region(s) and (iii) statistical measurements of synaptic innervation between all neurons within the model. We illustrate our approach by generating a dense average model of the entire rat vibrissal cortex, providing the required anatomical data, and illustrate how to measure synaptic innervation statistically. Comparing our results with data from paired recordings in vitro and in vivo, as well as with reconstructions of synaptic contact sites at light- and electron-microscopic levels, we find that our in silico measurements are in line with previous results.}, note={Citation Key: 10.3389/fnana.2014.00129}, journal={Frontiers in Neuroanatomy}, author={Egger, Robert and Dercksen, Vincent J. and Udvary, Daniel and Hege, Hans-Christian and Oberlaender, Marcel}, year={2014} }

This speciﬁcity in wiring can result from synapse formation mechanisms that connect neurons, depending on their electrical activity and genetically deﬁned identity. Here, we report that the morphological properties of the neurons provide an additional prominent source by which wiring speciﬁcity emerges in cortical networks. This morphologically determined wiring speciﬁcity reﬂects similarities between the neurons’ axo-dendritic projections patterns, the packing density, and the cellular diversity of the neuropil. The higher these three factors are, the more recurrent is the topology of the network. Conversely, the lower these factors are, the more feedforward is the network’s topology. These principles predict the empirically observed occurrences of clusters of synapses, cell typespeciﬁc connectivity patterns, and nonrandom network motifs. Thus, we demonstrate that wiring speciﬁcity emerges in the cerebral cortex at subcellular, cellular, and network scales from the speciﬁc morphological properties of its neuronal constituents.}, number={2}, journal={Cell Reports}, author={Udvary, Daniel and Harth, Philipp and Macke, Jakob H. and Hege, Hans-Christian and De Kock, Christiaan P.J. and Sakmann, Bert and Oberlaender, Marcel}, year={2022}, month=apr, pages={110677}, language={en} }

To quantify the effect of this morphological variability on the firing of layer 5 thick-tufted pyramidal cells (TTCs), a detailed conductance-based model was constructed for a three-dimensional reconstructed exemplar TTC. The model exhibited spike initiation in the axon and reproduced the characteristic features of individual spikes, as well as of the firing properties at the soma, as recorded in a population of TTCs in young Wistar rats. When using these model parameters over the population of 28 three-dimensional reconstructed TTCs, both axonal and somatic ion channel densities had to be scaled linearly with the conductance load imposed on each of these compartments. Otherwise, the firing of model cells deviated, sometimes very significantly, from the experimental variability of the TTC e-class. The study provides experimentally testable predictions regarding the coregulation of axosomatic membrane ion channels density for cells with different dendritic conductance load, together with a simple and systematic method for generating reliable conductance-based models for the whole population of modeled neurons belonging to a particular e-class, with variable morphology as found experimentally.}, number={12}, journal={Journal of Neurophysiology}, publisher={American Physiological Society}, author={Hay, Etay and Schürmann, Felix and Markram, Henry and Segev, Idan}, year={2013}, month=jun, pages={2972–2981} }

This is thought to influence neural information processing, but background levels of excitation and inhibition remain controversial. Here we show, using whole-cell recordings in anesthetized rats, that spontaneous depolarizations (“Up states”) in neocortical pyramidal neurons are driven by sparse, mostly excitatory synaptic activity (less than five inputs per millisecond; ∼10% inhibitory). The mean synaptic conductance change is small (<10 nS at the soma) and opposed by anomalous rectification, resulting in a net increase in input resistance during Up states. These conditions enhance the effectiveness of each synapse at depolarized potentials. Hence, neocortical networks are relatively quiet at rest, and the effect of synaptic background is weaker than previously thought.}, number={32}, journal={Journal of Neuroscience}, publisher={Society for Neuroscience}, author={Waters, Jack and Helmchen, Fritjof}, year={2006}, month=aug, pages={8267–8277}, language={en} }

How the dendritic location of inputs, their timing, strength, and presynaptic origin, in conjunction with complex dendritic physiology, impact the transformation of synaptic input into action potential (AP) output remains generally unknown for in vivo conditions. Here, we introduce a computational approach to reveal which properties of the input causally underlie AP output, and how this neuronal input-output computation is influenced by the morphology and biophysical properties of the dendrites. We demonstrate that this approach allows dissecting of how different input populations drive in vivo observed APs. For this purpose, we focus on fast and broadly tuned responses that pyramidal tract neurons in layer 5 (L5PTs) of the rat barrel cortex elicit upon passive single whisker deflections. By reducing a multi-scale model that we reported previously, we show that three features are sufficient to predict with high accuracy the sensory responses and receptive fields of L5PTs under these specific in vivo conditions: the count of active excitatory versus inhibitory synapses preceding the response, their spatial distribution on the dendrites, and the AP history. Based on these three features, we derive an analytically tractable description of the input-output computation of L5PTs, which enabled us to dissect how synaptic input from thalamus and different cell types in barrel cortex contribute to these responses. We show that the input-output computation is preserved across L5PTs despite morphological and biophysical diversity of their dendrites. We found that trial-to-trial variability in L5PT responses, and cell-to-cell variability in their receptive fields, are sufficiently explained by variability in synaptic input from the network, whereas variability in biophysical and morphological properties have minor contributions. Our approach to derive analytically tractable models of input-output computations in L5PTs provides a roadmap to dissect network-neuron interactions underlying L5PT responses across different in vivo conditions and for other cell types.}, number={4}, journal={PLOS Computational Biology}, publisher={Public Library of Science}, author={Bast, Arco and Fruengel, Rieke and Kock, Christiaan P.

First, sensory-evoked responses were layer- and cell-type-specific but always < 1 AP per stimulus, indicating low AP rates for the entire cortical column.

Each iteration forms linear approximations to the objective and constraint functions by interpolation at the vertices of a simplex and a trust region bound restricts each change to the variables. Thus a new vector of variables is calculated, which may replace one of the current vertices, either to improve the shape of the simplex or because it is the best vector that has been found so far, according to a merit function that gives attention to the greatest constraint violation. The trust region radius $\rho$ is never increased, and it is reduced when the approximations of a well-conditioned simplex fail to yield an improvement to the variables, until $\rho$ reaches a prescribed value that controls the final accuracy. Some convergence properties and several numerical results are given, but there are no more than 9 variables in these calculations because linear approximations can be highly inefficient.
