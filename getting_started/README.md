# Getting started

## Installation
This directory provides material for new users to show the possibilities of the in-silico-framework (ISF).
An installation guide can be found [in this notebook](./install_and_setup.ipynb), but it is as easy as:
```bash
./installer/py3.x/install.sh 
```
The installer folder further contains installation guides for NEURON, example data and notebooks to guide you through the Python framework. The notebooks show you how to set up simulations, how to use the Interface module, make visualisations and so on.

## Tutorials
The [notebooks directory](./notebooks/) provides many tutorials on a variety of workflows that can be achieved with ISF:

1. data analysis
2. biophysics
3. synaptic simulations
4. reduced models
5. network level simulations
6. visualization
7. data management
