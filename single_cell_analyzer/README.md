# Single Cell Analyzer

This module provides code to analyze the results of single-cell simulations and its network embeddings.

# membrane_potential_analysis

- Post-synaptic time histograms (PSTHs)
- Spike detection
- Simple statistics of membrane voltage

# currents

- Find time and voltage of max depolarisation (TODO: why is this in "currents"?)
- Compute currents in the soma

# Synapse analysis

synalalysis.py

Provides methods for analyzing the synaptic connections of the cell:
- Activation times of synapses
- intracellular distances
- distances to synapses
